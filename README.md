act as leader of the team, April 2011
Use a feedback algorithm to collect information about user’s preference on music
Select and play music continuously like a radio, according to user’s preference
• Related knowledge: C programming, UNIX system call


Note: Since this is the homework done in my undergraduate study in Beijing Institue of Technology, there are some drawbacks.
1 The comments are written in Chinese.
2 Since the professor requires the amount of codes, same code has been duplicated to provide both Chinese version and English version.

However, this is a good practice for the Unix System API.
Including but not limited to file system operation, thread programming, play music.
Since the focus is on the Unix System programming, the random pick alogrithm is not designed to be complex.
